Enjoy a simple game of Hangman with this project. Hangman is single player game where the computer picks a word at random based on a category player selects, and the play has to guess the letters that are included in the word. The player has the chance to guess wrong 10 times before the game is restarted with a different word.

The tools I use in building this web app are:
* Next.js
* TailwindCSS
* Bootstrap
* TypeScript
* Styled components
